### Final Reflections

Solving AOC 2020 problems has been a ton of fun and I am now much more familiar with Python 3. AOC is a great way to practise problem-solving and learn a new language. This has been the first year I've solved all the challenges, so I am very pleased with myself. I may write some editorial blogs on my favourite AOC 2020 problems. See you next year! ðŸŽŠ
